# Spacer

A circular-arena turret defense arcade, refactored from galaga-reloaded with a fresh core loop (heat management, abilities, shop) while keeping the neon-on-midnight theme and Canvas UI.

## Quick start

1. Install deps
	- npm install
2. Dev server
	- npm run dev
3. Preview production build
	- npm run build && npm run preview

Open the URL printed in the terminal.

## Controls (M1 scaffold)

- Aim: move the mouse (or drag on touch)
- Fire: hold mouse/touch
- Audio toggle: press m (click canvas first to init audio)

See docs/design-plan.md for the full roadmap and module map.
